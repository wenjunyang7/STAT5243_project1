Project tittle: Happiness of Parents

This project is conducted by Wenjun Yang
# Project summary
The project discussed the cause of parent happiness and eliminated the influence of age. I would process raw data to convert text data into corpus for analysis. I would apply word cloud and bar chart to illuminate the result. I used two table, "hm_data" and "demographic". The first table, "hm_data", records the text of happy moment from workers. The second table are information of these works.
